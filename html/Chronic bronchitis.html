                <h2>Chronic bronchitis:</h2><br>
    
                <h3>It Includes:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Chronic bronchitis is a condition that affects the lungs and airways. Itâ€™s one of several lung conditions which come under the umbrella of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).</li>
                    <li> Most cases of bronchitis develop as a result of an infection that irritates the bronchi (airways), causing an overproduction of mucus. The body tries to shift this excess mucus via coughing. Chronic bronchitis is when this coughing continues daily for several months of the year, for two years or more.</li><br>
                    
                    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Hacking cough, which may bring up mucus.</li>
                        <li>A sore throat.</li>
                        <li>Headaches.</li>
                        <li>A runny or blocked nose.</li>
                        <li>Fatigue.</li>
                        <li>Aches and pains in your chest.</li><br>  
                        
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Most cases of acute bronchitis do not need medical treatment. Usually, they will clear up by themselves within a few weeks. Instead, you should simply drink plenty of fluids and get lots of rest to help control your symptoms and ease any pain.</li>
                            <li>Drinking plenty of fluids will help to prevent dehydration, whilst also thinning the mucus in your lungs. You can also treat any headaches, temperatures, or aches with paracetamol or ibuprofen. However, ibuprofen is not recommended for those with asthma.</li>
                            <li>Unfortunately, there is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, some simple lifestyle changes can be very effective when it comes to easing your symptoms. If you are a smoker, it is absolutely essential that you quit smoking without delay. Continuing to smoke will make your symptoms worse and can make them last much, much longer.</li>
