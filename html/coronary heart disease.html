                <h2>Coronary Heart Disease:</h2><br>
    
                <h3>It Includes:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Coronary heart disease is one of the leading causes of death here in the UK. According to the NHS, coronary heart disease (CHD) is what happens when fatty substances build up in the arteries, blocking the blood supply to the heart.</li><br>
                    
                    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
                    
                    <ol>        
                        <li>Heart Failure – a weakening of the heart that prevents it from effectively pumping blood around the body. It can occur gradually or suddenly. Heart failure is usually not curable, but proper treatment can help you manage it for many years.</li>
                        <li>Heart Attack – this is when a blockage in a blood vessel cuts off the blood supply, starving the heart of oxygen. The symptoms of a heart attack are similar to those of angina (chest pains, nausea, breathlessness) but much more severe. Heart attacks are very serious and can be life-threatening.</li>
                        <li>Swollen ankles, feet or hands.</li>
                        <li>Tiredness.</li><br>  
                        
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li> Medications - Furthermore, there is a wide range of medications for CHD.</li>
                            <li>Blood thinners can prevent the formation of blood clots, therefore reducing your risk of a heart attack.</li>
                            <li>Statins work by reducing your cholesterol. The higher your cholesterol, the higher your chances of a heart attack.</li>
                            <li>Beta blockers are often used to treat high blood pressure. They can help to prevent angina by slowing your heartbeat and improving blood flow.</li>
                        </ol>
