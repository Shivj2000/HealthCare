                <h2>Asthma:</h2><br>
        
                <h3>It Includes:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Asthma occurs when the body’s airways are sensitive to allergens and become inflamed</li>
                    <li>This inflammation can cause a painful and frightening asthma attack, which causes the airway muscles to tighten and narrow, making it hard to breathe. Most people can manage their asthma very effectively with proper medication. However, asthma left unchecked can be fatal.</li>
                    <li> On average, 3 people die every day from an asthma attack in the UK.</li><br>
                    
                    
                    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
                    <ol>
                         <li>Coughing.</li>
                         <li>A tight sensation in the chest.</li>
                         <li>Breathlessness</li>
                         <li>Older people are susceptible to asthma and should be on the lookout for symptoms, especially during the winter months. Asthma can worsen during and after a bout of cold or flu.</li><br> 
                        
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li> The most common form of treatment is an inhaler. There are two main types of inhalers:</li>
                             <li> Reliever Inhaler – These can relieve symptoms for a short period of time. They are commonly blue.</li>
                             <li> Preventer Inhaler – These reduce the inflammation in your breathing tubes. They need to be used twice daily in order to be most effective. They are commonly brown.</li>
                        </ol>
