                <h2>Deep vein thrombosis:</h2><br>
    
                <h3>It Includes:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Deep vein thrombosis is a blood clot in your deep veins, most commonly in one of your legs. This medical condition is most common in people over the age of 40, and can also lead to further complications, including pulmonary embolism.</li>
                    <li> There are a number of factors that can increase your risk of DVT. These include obesity, blood vessel damage, being inactive for long periods of time, and a family history of blood blots.</li><br>
                    
                    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>    
                    <ol>        
                        <li>Pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs.</li>
                        <li>A heavy ache in the affected area.</li>
                        <li>Red skin – particularly at the back of your leg, below the knee.</li>
                        <li>Warm skin in the area of the clot.</li>
                         <li>A mild fever.</li><br>  

                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Heparin & Warfarin - In most cases, doctors will prescribe heparin first, because it starts working immediately to prevent clots.</li>
                            <li>Standard (unfractioned) – can come in an injection straight into one of your veins or via a continuous drip into a vein in your arm. It can also be given as an injection under your skin.</li>
                            <li>Low molecular weight – Usually comes as an injection under your skin.</li>
                             <li>Limit your alcohol intake.</li> 
                            <li>Keep your diet consistent.</li>
                             <li>Don’t take any herbal medicine.</li>
                             <li>Take your dose of warfarin at the same time every day.</li>
                             <li>Don’t start any other medicine without checking with your doctor.  </li>
            
                        </ol>
