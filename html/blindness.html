                <h2>Blindness:</h2><br>
        
                <h3>It Includes:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Around two million people are living with sight loss here in the UK, with 360,000 people registered as blind or partially sighted.</li>
                    <li>The leading cause of blindness is age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which affects more than 600,000 people in the UK. AMD occurs when deposits build up on the macula (a small area at the centre of the retina). AMD can also be caused by abnormal blood vessels developing under the macula.</li>
                    <li> Other medical conditions can cause sight loss too – such as glaucoma and diabetes. Diabetic retinopathy damages the retina, leading to sight loss. Treatments for sight loss vary depending on the cause</li><br>
                    
                    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>
                    <ol>
                         <li>AMD primarily affects the middle of your vision, as opposed to your periphery. Reading may become difficult and colours may appear less vibrant than before. You may also find it hard to recognise people’s faces.</li>
                         <li>Both eyes tend to be affected by AMD eventually, though you may only notice problems in one eye at first. Symptoms linked to dry AMD include text becoming blurry, needing a brighter light than normal when reading, and hazy vision.</li>
                         <li>Symptoms linked to wet AMD include visual distortions (such as straight lines appearing wavy), blind spots appearing and hallucinations such as shapes and people that aren’t really there.</li><br>   
                        
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Magnifying lenses.</li>
                            <li>Very bright reading lights.</li>
                            <li>Large-print books.</li>
                             <li>Screen-reading software to make it easier to use your computer or mobile phone.</li>
                        </ol>    
                </ol><br>
