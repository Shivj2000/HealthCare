                <h2>High cholesterol:</h2><br>
        
                <h3>It Includes:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> A fatty substance which is made in the liver. It’s found in some foods too.</li>
                    <li>It forms part of the outer layer of all the body’s cells.</li>
                    <li>The body needs it to make Vitamin D and several hormones which support bones, teeth, and muscles.</li>
                    <li>It also helps the body to make bile, which aids digestion.</li><br>
                                   
                    <h3>Symptoms:</h3>    
                    <ol>        
                        <li> You’re likely aware that high cholesterol is bad for your health. However, high cholesterol levels don’t cause symptoms. You’ll need to get a blood test in order to find out your cholesterol level. The recommended levels vary depending on your risk of developing arterial disease.</li><br>  
                        
                        
                        <h3>Treatment:</h3>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Statins. Statins block a substance your liver needs to make cholesterol. This causes your liver to remove cholesterol from your blood. Choices include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor) and simvastatin (Zocor).</li>
                            <li>Cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Your small intestine absorbs the cholesterol from your diet and releases it into your bloodstream. The drug ezetimibe (Zetia) helps reduce blood cholesterol by limiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol. Ezetimibe can be used with a statin drug.</li>
                            <li>Bempedoic acid. This newer drug works in much the same way as statins but is less likely to cause muscle pain. Adding bempedoic acid (Nexletol) to a maximum statin dosage can help lower LDL significantly. A combination pill containing both bempedoic acid and ezetimibe (Nexlizet) also is available.</li> 
                        </ol>    
                </ol><br>
